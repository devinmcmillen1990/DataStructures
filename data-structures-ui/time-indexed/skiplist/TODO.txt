1. Setup quick description of the algorithm to include some external source activating the expire method.
2. Setup a timed-ticker (provide warning on why this is a bad practice).
3. Setup button to invoke expire_front() (Let the user know that this should be invoked during the process)
4. Activate ticker when there are values and deactivate ticker otherwise.
5. Fix Visual (Have it try to match data-structures/src/time_indexed/skip_list_expiry_notes.txt)
6. Fix the Operations Window
7. Update pseudo code to include details about the external click.
8. Get official paper or resources for this algorithm. (THIS IS REALLY MORE OF AN ALGORITHM).
9. Setup SEO crap.
