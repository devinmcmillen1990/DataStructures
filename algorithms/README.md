| Redis Hybrid Expiry               | Combines lazy and active expiration strategies.                        | Redis in-memory key-value store        | Used by Redis for TTL on keys with fast performance.                 |
| MongoDB TTL Index                 | B-tree index on datetime field scanned by background thread.           | MongoDB TTL Index                      | Used in MongoDB for automatic document expiration.                   |
| Time Wheel / Hashed Wheel Timer  | Circular buffer for efficient scheduling of expirations.               | Kafka, Netty                           | Used in Kafka for request timeouts and Netty for networking events.  |
| Skip List with Expiry Buckets    | Skip list levels correspond to time-based expiry buckets.              | Custom implementation (e.g., your system) | Ideal for range TTL queries and fast access with concurrency.       |
| Hierarchical Timing Wheel        | Multi-level time wheels for different time granularities.              | Akka, Linux kernel                     | Used for fine-grained timer management and network stack timeouts.   |
| Calendar Queue                   | Priority queue optimized for uniform time distributions.               | Simulation engines                     | Used in discrete event simulations for scheduled events.             |
| Segmented Expiry Maps            | Data segmented by time intervals; expired by segment removal.          | Time-series DBs, log processors        | Efficient in analytics for dropping old data in batches.            |
| CRON-style Schedulers            | Scheduled task expiration using real-world time patterns.              | Quartz Scheduler, Kubernetes CronJobs  | Useful in enterprise applications and job orchestration.            |
| Lock-Free Delay Queue            | Thread-safe queue sorted by expiration time with CAS operations.       | Java DelayQueue                        | Used in concurrent environments for precise delay scheduling.        |
