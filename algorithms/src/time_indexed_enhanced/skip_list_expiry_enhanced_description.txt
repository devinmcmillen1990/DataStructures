Enhancements Summary
1. Flat Vector for Buckets
    - Replaced VecDeque<BTreeSet<T>> with Vec<Vec<T>> to reduce memory and allocation overhead.
    - Deduplication is enforced manually using .contains() before pushing.

2. RwLock Instead of Mutex
    - Using RwLock instead of Mutex to allow concurrent readers, improving scalability in read-heavy scenarios.

3. Atomic Bucket Time
    - Moved bucket_time to AtomicUsize to reduce lock contention when updating time.

4. Memory Preallocation
    - Buckets are preallocated with Vec::with_capacity(32) to avoid frequent reallocations.

5. Rotation Optimization
    - Leveraged rotate_left(1) for fast bucket advancement without shifting memory manually.
