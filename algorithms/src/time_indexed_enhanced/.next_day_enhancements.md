# Skip List Expiry (Enhanced)
    âœ… Enhancements to Apply
        - VecDeque replaces Vec for efficient rotation.
        - Bucket reuse via clear() instead of allocating new vectors.
        - AHashMap (via ahash crate) replaces standard HashMap for faster hashing.
        - Additional polish and preallocation improvements for cache efficiency.
