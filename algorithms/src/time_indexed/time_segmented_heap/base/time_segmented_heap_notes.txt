Reddit Post:
I came across this paper on a memory allocation technique called Segment Heap:

https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Yason-Windows-10-Segment-Heap-Internals.pdf

Reading through this paper, it's unclear to me what exactly this entails, does anyone have an explanation 
and/or a pointer to something that gives a bit more in terms of explanations?

Response:
Note: I'm not an expert, this is just what I could gather by what I read in that link and others.

The heap is the place that windows allocates memory to programs that are run. So there is space in the heap for 
chrome, word, etc. There are multiple heaps in windows and different programs are assigned to a different heap 
based on some criteria.

At the time of the article a new heap came out called the Win10 segment heap, it is used for things like windows 
metro apps which are that windows 8 tablet garbage that everyone hates. It seems what windows has called these 
apps has changed multiple times. Another thing that uses this Win10 segment heap is apparently edge.

The article focuses on how the heap works and how to exploit it to do hacker things.
